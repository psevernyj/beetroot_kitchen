                    <p>Subscriptions are a critical part of many newsroom business models.
                        Newsrooms are using a variety of strategies to find new subscribers,
                        from advertising via email to using sponsored posts on social media.
                        But what works and what doesnâ€™t?</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this report is to provide data on several possible strategies.
                        This research was funded by the American Press Institute and involved two steps.
                        We first conducted in-depth interviews with staff from six news organizations with strong
                        reputations for securing donations or subscriptions. Informed by these conversations,
                        we then conducted experiments in collaboration with three U.S. newsrooms:
                        one mid-sized local newspaper in the southwest, one small regional news
                        magazine in the west, and one large local newspaper in the southwest.</p>
