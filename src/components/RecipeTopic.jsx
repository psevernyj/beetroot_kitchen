                            We put salt, sugar, pepper, vinegar and mustard into our food to make it salted,
                            sweet, sour or simply tasty. Our food may taste good or bad or it may be tasteless.

                            The usual meals in England are breakfast,
                            lunch, tea and dinner or, in simpler houses,
                            breakfast, dinner, tea and supper.

                            For breakfast English people mostly have porridge
                            or corn-flakes with milk or cream and sugar, bacon
                            and eggs, marmalade with buttered toast and tea or coffee.
                            For a change they can have a boiled egg, cold ham, or fish.

                            English people generally have lunch about one o'clock.
                            At lunch time in a London restaurant one usually finds
                            a mutton chop, or steak and chips, or cold meat or fish
                            with potatoes and salad, then a pudding or fruit to follow.
